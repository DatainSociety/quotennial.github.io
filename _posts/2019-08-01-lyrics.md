# Analysing UK Rap Scene

Using the file `lyricgetter.py` to utilise the lyricgenius API. Able to pull the lyrics for all UK rappers and store it in a sqlitedb. Inspired By https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/

Some visulaisation libraries https://www.sitepoint.com/best-javascript-charting-libraries/

Looks like a readable function https://canvasjs.com/html5-javascript-scatter-point-chart/
- do this to visualise words/unique words per song and size relating to number of songs

Then a bar plot showing total unique words
Word cloud showing the most popular words
