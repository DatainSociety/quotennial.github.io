I am a Data Engineer at Connected Places Catapult with a background in Computer Science and Economic Geography, based in London. Interested in cities, innovation, causality and everything in between. 

Research background in innovation, using patent networks, looking at the spatial distribution and local factors affecting innovation. Building a network of patent citations and using flow analysis to find the most influential patents. 

This personal blog will contain some data-science projects and creating data visualisations, alongside some hobby projects.  Hopefully there is something for everyone in these articles, whether it is the results, programming, methods or use of datasets. I hope you enjoy reading and please let me know what you think :blush:
