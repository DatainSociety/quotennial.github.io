This post will use the data collected in a previous post to analyse the T.V.show FRIENDS. This has been an aim of mine since I first started learning to program and has been a really enjoyable hobby project. Hopefully it provides an alternative look at the most looked-at show. As always, feel free to skip the coding bits and jump to the visualisations, hope you enjoy!
